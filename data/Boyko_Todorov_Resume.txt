---Summary---

I'm an engineer with hands-on experience in a variety of programming languages and tools. My journey has involved building new systems from the ground up and improving the ones already in place. I take joy in developing systems that are user-friendly and easy for other engineers to work with. I also value sharing knowledge and helping colleagues grow in their careers. For the past few years, I have been exploring the exciting and possibly scary world of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, and Large Language Models.
